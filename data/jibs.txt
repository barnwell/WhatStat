18/11/2016, 2:33:11 pm: Bananna: I think it means really awkward
18/11/2016, 2:34:27 pm: Nick: No, surely it's a grinning face?
18/11/2016, 2:35:00 pm: Bananna: Surely it's a grimacing face?

18/11/2016, 6:37:56 pm: Nick: It's all in the eyes...
18/11/2016, 6:38:05 pm: Bananna: Maybe I've been using it wrong..

18/11/2016, 9:40:57 pm: Jim Riddiford: Football is at 3 but come round whenever - it's a pretty chilled evening - most of my friends have babies so aren't around! X
18/11/2016, 9:52:25 pm: Bananna: Ok well I'll think about timings and working out. So what's mystery girl called?
18/11/2016, 10:23:17 pm: Jim Riddiford: Rachel
19/11/2016, 12:08:54 am: Bananna: Nice. Ok. I might come earlier to you any then consider leaving to go to theirs later xx
19/11/2016, 12:10:09 am: Bananna: Is she going to be there at 3? I hate football so I just want to check there will be another girl there...
19/11/2016, 1:08:57 am: Jim Riddiford: Yeah, she'll be there from 3.

23/11/2016, 10:27:36 am: Josh Bilton: Yeah I'm keen.  Jim are you interested? if so I can try and book two courts for 11am so we can all play
23/11/2016, 11:17:48 am: Jim Riddiford: I've got a tree surgeon coming round on sat so can't make it unfortunately!
23/11/2016, 6:39:09 pm: Josh Bilton: Ok, hmmm we could get one court and rotate? Or I can try and find another player.
23/11/2016, 6:57:46 pm: Nick: Either way works for me
23/11/2016, 6:58:39 pm: Nick: Although rotating would mean that I don't need to bring my racquet
23/11/2016, 6:59:12 pm: Nick: And then brunch in that place we went to Anna?
24/11/2016, 12:00:32 am: Josh Bilton: Squash booked for 10:40am and then brunch whoop!!

12/01/2017, 10:44:00 am: Josh Bilton: I'd be up for a climbing session to see if I'm a climber kinda of guy.  Next week Tuesday is good
12/01/2017, 11:01:19 am: Jim Riddiford: Great! How does a 745 start sound?
12/01/2017, 11:26:58 am: Josh Bilton: Perfecto!!
12/01/2017, 11:58:34 am: Jim Riddiford: Awesome!

16/01/2017, 12:33:21 pm: Jim Riddiford: Hey josh, tomorrow is looking doubtful for me because I've hurt my arm, but could do Thursday or Saturday morning? Or next Tuesday?
16/01/2017, 12:38:41 pm: Josh Bilton: Oh no, sorry to hear that.  Thursday is good or Saturday or Tuesday.  Do you want to see how your arm goes and let me know?
16/01/2017, 12:41:25 pm: Jim Riddiford: Cool, will give you a shout on Wednesday..
17/01/2017, 8:12:50 pm: Jim Riddiford: Hi Josh I'm definitely going to be available on Thursday so are you still on for 745 then?
17/01/2017, 10:15:15 pm: Josh Bilton: Yo!! Sounds good.  Do I need special shoes or anything?
17/01/2017, 10:31:08 pm: Jim Riddiford: Awesome, you need climbing shoes but you can rent them at the wall
18/01/2017, 8:14:29 pm: Josh Bilton: Hey Jim.  I've got this art proposal to hand in for tomorrow and it's taking a lot more effort than I thought, is there any chance we can postpone to Saturday or Tuesday.  Sorry to be so last minute I just need to get the extra hours tomorrow morning and start early.
18/01/2017, 8:14:30 pm: Josh Bilton: <‚Äéimage omitted>

26/04/2017, 10:34:04 am: Nick: Would love a game of squash when I'm back if anyone's keen?
26/04/2017, 10:34:55 am: Nick: Abnormally few broadcasts on #jiblings FM recently!
26/04/2017, 12:11:00 pm: Jim Riddiford: Would be keen - maybe even some climbing?
26/04/2017, 1:41:58 pm: Bananna: I know. Shall we all play together?
26/04/2017, 1:42:14 pm: Bananna: Is it this weekend that your back?
26/04/2017, 1:42:24 pm: Bananna: I'm really losing track of things?
26/04/2017, 2:00:56 pm: Nick: Sounds good - either day works for me (6/7th may)
29/04/2017, 10:04:48 am: Josh Bilton: Brothers from other mothers! Whose keen for climbing next Saturday followed by brunch in Brixton?
29/04/2017, 10:05:20 am: Jim Riddiford: Yeah for sure!

29/04/2017, 10:06:37 am: Nick: Definitely- is there a climbing place in Brixton?
29/04/2017, 10:06:51 am: Josh Bilton: Anna's spelling correction of whose but I don't think that is right either.  Dyslexic battle off
29/04/2017, 10:07:26 am: Josh Bilton: It's in Bermondsey but we need to start early before  the crowds come in.
29/04/2017, 10:59:44 am: Nick: Keen for squash or climbing so whatever's easiest
29/04/2017, 10:59:59 am: Nick: Definitely want to get back to that brunch place in Brixton!

04/05/2017, 5:17:33 pm: Josh Bilton: Good for me.  Looking forward
04/05/2017, 6:00:04 pm: Nick: Arriving at 7.30 I think
05/05/2017, 1:32:39 pm: Bananna: Ah ok. I was wondering if it would be earlier as I'm free from 5.30 in Euston. 7.30 is a bit too late x
06/05/2017, 1:53:06 am: Nick: Spoiler alert: I'm going to be a wee bit hung over tomorrow
06/05/2017, 1:53:41 am: Nick: <‚Äéimage omitted>

06/05/2017, 10:38:51 am: Jim Riddiford: Big time
06/05/2017, 10:39:28 am: Nick: Ok is someone driving?
06/05/2017, 10:39:46 am: Jim Riddiford: No im getting the train
06/05/2017, 10:39:48 am: Josh Bilton: We could swing by and pick you up now but we'll be a bit late Jim.
06/05/2017, 10:40:50 am: Josh Bilton: Hey this is Anna - we're 10 mins away so get ready quickly.
06/05/2017, 10:41:13 am: Josh Bilton: Josh's brother is also coming

23/05/2017, 12:14:53 am: Josh Bilton: Got my old guitar back Nick form my parents.  Inspired by your playing last weekend.
23/05/2017, 7:45:51 am: Nick: Sounds great! We'll have to jam next time I'm back!
23/05/2017, 8:00:57 am: Jim Riddiford: Nice!
23/05/2017, 8:18:25 am: Nick: Did someone say family band?
23/05/2017, 8:22:26 am: Josh Bilton: I did
23/05/2017, 8:22:32 am: Josh Bilton: Whoop
30/05/2017, 1:47:31 pm: Bananna: Jim have you book Paris? If so what times are your trains? And where are you staying? Xx
30/05/2017, 1:53:06 pm: Jim Riddiford: I was planning on staying with nick - will send train times on later xx
30/05/2017, 2:19:05 pm: Bananna: Ok cool
30/05/2017, 9:54:17 pm: Nick: Anna can you let me know before you book (if you do) and you can book under my account
30/05/2017, 9:54:44 pm: Nick: (So I get money off future travel)
02/06/2017, 12:50:43 pm: Bananna: Ok will do - how are you coming along with those train times Jim?
02/06/2017, 12:51:31 pm: Bananna: I'm also just working out what to do as unfortunately josh won't be able to come. I imagine that it'll be too crowded for me to stay at yours nick?
02/06/2017, 2:13:05 pm: Nick: Definitely do-able (two sofa beds in one room), one comfy, can't vouch for the other but I'm sure it's fine!
02/06/2017, 2:28:50 pm: Jim Riddiford: I booked tickets with Eurostar but they haven't sent me a confirmation, so can't remember train times. Will get on the phone with them to sort..
02/06/2017, 5:42:23 pm: Nick: <‚Äéimage omitted>
02/06/2017, 5:50:30 pm: Josh Bilton: Ha!! Is that your dog??

08/06/2017, 10:53:29 am: Bananna: Also jim, train times for Eurostar? ... I'm starting to think you don't want to be stuck on the same train as me for two hours...
08/06/2017, 10:59:26 am: Jim Riddiford: Eurostar have taken my money but haven't sent me any confirmation of my tickets! I spent 30 mins in a phone queue trying to speak to someone the other day - will try again today!
08/06/2017, 11:02:54 am: Bananna: Oh no! Well I work very near there - if you need someone to go down to talk in person I could - though I don't know if that would be helpful...
08/06/2017, 1:53:02 pm: Nick: Got some promising leads for les catacombs for your visit!
08/06/2017, 7:08:04 pm: Bananna: As in illegal?

12/06/2017, 9:53:39 pm: Jim Riddiford: When was that?
12/06/2017, 9:53:45 pm: Jim Riddiford: Looking good
12/06/2017, 11:22:17 pm: Josh Bilton: Ha!! It's was at the RCA when I dressed like a tosser.   It was only seven years ago, not really enough time to justify putting a purple shirt with blue üëñ.
13/06/2017, 9:40:51 am: Nick: Brilliant!
13/06/2017, 4:34:18 pm: Bananna: Hey Jim - any word on the Eurostar times? I'll book mine soon so if not will just book times that work for me xx

18/06/2017, 2:16:28 pm: Jim Riddiford: Any plans for our Paris weekend nick ? I'm trying to organise seeing a couple of people from On Purpose so let me know when you think we need to do things like catacomb tour etc

18/06/2017, 3:12:59 pm: Nick: Great!
18/06/2017, 3:13:56 pm: Nick: Nothing locked in yet - secret catacombes is through a friend of a friend so I'll ask her again next week
18/06/2017, 3:15:25 pm: Nick: Plenty of non-subterranean activities too so we can just play it by ear
18/06/2017, 3:16:56 pm: Nick: Fontainebleau was a thought too
18/06/2017, 3:28:22 pm: Jim Riddiford: Cool - if I book in Saturday lunch with a friend is that likely to cut across any plans?
18/06/2017, 3:43:44 pm: Nick: No we can work around it
18/06/2017, 3:44:25 pm: Nick: (Although Sunday would be better if we want to go onto a park on sat)
19/06/2017, 11:45:31 am: Jim Riddiford: Cool, have changed lunch to Sunday.
19/06/2017, 2:12:04 pm: Nick: Excellent!

19/06/2017, 5:31:03 pm: Bananna: Dress-up optional
19/06/2017, 5:37:36 pm: Jim Riddiford: I'm going to be in Colombia I'm afraid!
19/06/2017, 5:38:15 pm: Jim Riddiford: Very keen to go for birthday drinks when I'm back though! X
19/06/2017, 5:39:06 pm: Bananna: Wow that's awesome, hoe come you're going and when are you back?

19/06/2017, 5:41:56 pm: Jim Riddiford: B) Saturday 12th August
27/06/2017, 6:52:35 pm: Bananna: Getting excited about Paris!! Hope it's not raining there
27/06/2017, 6:53:01 pm: Bananna: Also Jim should we aim to meet before getting on the train?
27/06/2017, 7:59:40 pm: Jim Riddiford: Yes that's a good plan. I can be at kings cross at 430? X
28/06/2017, 8:54:09 am: Nick: Looking forward to seeing you both - hopefully the weather will hold!
28/06/2017, 8:54:28 am: Nick: Could someone bring a bottle of pimms?
28/06/2017, 8:54:51 am: Nick: Doesn't seem to exist outside of the UK
28/06/2017, 9:01:18 am: Josh Bilton: Anna is loaded with Pimm's wooooo!! Josh is sad he's not coming, next time booooo!!
28/06/2017, 9:03:59 am: Nick: <‚Äéimage omitted>
28/06/2017, 9:31:48 am: Josh Bilton: Ha!! It looks so much like you Nick.
30/06/2017, 8:37:07 am: Nick: So what time do you arrive this evening?
30/06/2017, 8:37:38 am: Nick: I'm doing my best to persuade the weather to not be shitty...
30/06/2017, 9:01:55 am: Bananna: I think it's just before 9pm
30/06/2017, 9:09:03 am: Jim Riddiford: <‚Äéimage omitted>
30/06/2017, 9:09:12 am: Jim Riddiford: What's your address?

30/06/2017, 9:45:42 am: Nick: I'll come to Gare du Nord to meet you!
30/06/2017, 9:46:16 am: Jim Riddiford: I reckon it's sensible for us to eat on the train..
30/06/2017, 3:44:07 pm: Bananna: Hi Jim and nick, very unfortunately and very stupidly I have realised my passport is a month out of date so I think it is extremely unlikely that I will get through security... sorry
30/06/2017, 3:47:03 pm: Bananna: Jim I can still meet you and give you the pimms. I don't know if it's worth chancing it.
30/06/2017, 3:47:16 pm: Nick: Call them and ask if it's possible with another form of Id
30/06/2017, 3:48:08 pm: Bananna: I don't have any other ID. And I called them and they said nothing could be done. Really disappointed
30/06/2017, 3:48:24 pm: Jim Riddiford: Oh dear
30/06/2017, 3:49:20 pm: Nick: That's a shame, you'll have to book another visit when the weather's a bit better!
30/06/2017, 4:26:27 pm: Bananna: Is it worth exchanging them?  Are you about on august or Sep?
30/06/2017, 4:28:20 pm: Nick: If you're able to exchange them I would
30/06/2017, 4:28:33 pm: Nick: Sometime in Sept?
30/06/2017, 4:51:02 pm: Bananna: It costs s lot to change them so I'm not sure. Really am gutted as I was looking forward to it and to seeing you both. Xx
30/06/2017, 9:22:30 pm: Jim Riddiford: Aiming to be there just after 10
