15/03/2016, 2:07:51 pm: Marc Gosschalk: I'm probably a neg, but are there monies involved?
15/03/2016, 2:18:45 pm: Nick: ¬£18

15/03/2016, 5:21:38 pm: Hood: Boulle's wanting to book the Dulwichers a clubhouse out West for Easter weekend and he's delegated the task to Sheryl. I'm helping her by asking who might be interested.

15/03/2016, 5:39:03 pm: Mat Gallagher: Is she really sheryl and not Cheryl?
15/03/2016, 5:39:30 pm: Peter Boull√©: Can we focus on the point of hood's message please.
15/03/2016, 5:42:22 pm: Nick: The devil's in the detail Bou
15/03/2016, 6:02:10 pm: Hood: Shezza or Chezza

15/03/2016, 6:14:54 pm: Nick: And performance review
15/03/2016, 6:15:49 pm: Peter Boull√©: Yes, it is finally time to accept the shifting sands upon which we have built our foundations and apply our social architecture skills to shore up das klubhause for the next 15 years of camaraderie.
15/03/2016, 6:16:39 pm: Peter Boull√©: Im fear the review will lead to redundancies and pitiful bonuses
15/03/2016, 6:35:07 pm: Hood: Are you doing what you do best Peter and sacking the Dulwichers to create a tax efficient shell registered in the BVI with the sole beneficiary a Mr P. Boull√©?
15/03/2016, 6:46:02 pm: Peter Boull√©: Nonsense Hood. The Dulwichers will be given generous* new packages, all they have to do is relocate to beckenham and undertake eternal allegiance to me (and pledge all their assets and souls to me as security for performance of that undertaking). I can't say fairer than that given recent performance. We** have all got to tighten our belts in these tough socio-economic times.

** you
15/03/2016, 6:53:10 pm: Hood: This banter is premium quality all round guys. Its triple AAA rating will no doubt somehow serve to enrich our corporate overlord.
15/03/2016, 6:56:27 pm: Peter Boull√©: Buy rated banter, no doubt about it. No junk bonds here. Can we get back to the point or shall we continue down this tangent?
15/03/2016, 7:04:13 pm: Arunani: If the tangent is on-point are we even off-point?
15/03/2016, 7:06:36 pm: Arunani: Am very keen to get involved with a dulwicher hook up this Thursday if that is still on the cards.
15/03/2016, 8:44:30 pm: Hood: Bubbs your proposal has been stymied by your own devilry
15/03/2016, 9:03:57 pm: Charlie Williamson: I pledge allegiance. To the Boo. The King is dead. Long live the Boo.
15/03/2016, 10:58:08 pm: Hood: üëë

04/04/2016, 2:30:09 pm: Peter Boull√©: I dont know what you mean Hood. They have 'operated beyond reproach for 40 years'. Query whether that means that they have operated in a manner not deserving reproach or beyond the purview of reproach that might otherwise be deserving? And no i have not.
04/04/2016, 2:32:31 pm: Peter Boull√©: I have been operating beyond reproach for 7 years.
04/04/2016, 2:33:27 pm: Hood: I thought the same thing, in less eloquent terms. An odd thing to say
04/04/2016, 2:35:49 pm: Peter Boull√©: Indeed. I am concerned for the safety of whoever it was who took it upon themselves to leak those papers though. Suspect they might have pissed off some very powerful and not very scrupulous people...
04/04/2016, 2:39:52 pm: Hood: Is that what's kept you from dishing the dirt? I'm fairly sure the FBI offer a tidy package for their noble informants. Private island, 24 hour security, unlimited skittles. Much like one of your craven havens.

20/04/2016, 4:15:29 am: Chris Raeburn: Looks by now like he didn't win. Quite a bad blow for his run to not get this one and probably makes a late turnaround out of reach. Archaic voting laws didn't help. Not sure how much gets reported elsewhere but you have to be a registered Dem to vote in their primary and be in the system by last October. Given that Sanders attracted a lot of independents, he missed out on a large number of votes from people who hadn't registered so far in advance. TBH, I'm not as down on Hilary as a lot of people are. I think she will make a very competent prez, she has just not campaigned well. That said, it's great that she has been pushed all the way by Sanders as it is has dragged her back to the left and helped her *revise* some of her more questionable positions.
20/04/2016, 4:15:50 am: Chris Raeburn: Happy to wake up in the morning and be proven wrong...
20/04/2016, 4:28:21 am: Charlie Williamson: Nice analysis and sort of how I'm feeling about this.

29/05/2016, 12:43:46 pm: Hood: Watched the masterpiece perhaps 20 times. Bubbs' commentary, Dan's execution/celebration, the camera work, the laughter, the comic timing... could not be better. Will try it out on some characters here and see if it's universal. Or just a bunch of tanked up geezers blundering around old haunts.
29/05/2016, 12:44:47 pm: Hood: Although Jacko needs to fix the tilty screen

14/06/2016, 1:56:27 pm: Chris Raeburn: Through a half-baked logic, does this necessitate that the name of the next offspring begin with F (and be male)? Farnsworth Williamson?

14/06/2016, 2:50:34 pm: Hood: Rest assured Gosschalk's could be a G having been once round the alphapet. Or in the 4th or 5th word.
14/06/2016, 3:47:47 pm: Mat Gallagher: So that suj junior enters a unified world. Here is a good lse article on brexit

24/06/2016, 5:39:14 am: Hood: We're fucked. Farage is giving a victory speech. Europe is over.

24/06/2016, 5:49:59 am: Charlie Williamson: Mass dulwicher migration to Australia? Seems the next logical step

24/06/2016, 7:51:24 am: Peter Boull√©: Here in ny everyone is just bemused as to why the uk would choose to score such a colossal own goal.
24/06/2016, 7:53:58 am: Sam Davies: The voting breakdown suggests it's the over 50's wot swung it
24/06/2016, 7:54:26 am: Sam Davies: Oz, NZ or Canada seem good options

24/06/2016, 7:58:19 am: Peter Boull√©: Yup. Lets do it
24/06/2016, 8:02:39 am: Peter Boull√©: I genuinely dont understand where go from here. Im very rarely driven to melodrama or exaggeration. But this is seriously fucked.
24/06/2016, 8:04:54 am: Perkvez: I wander what Eshan and Dastaan are gonna think of this once they're older and reading about it in their school history books.

Colossal fuck up or a good move?
24/06/2016, 8:08:48 am: Peter Boull√©: I sincerely hope for their sake this is a good move. But right now i dont see how...

24/06/2016, 11:18:44 am: Arunani: Bit podgier than Le Chalk. Holman was certainly doing that pseudo-Piaf in the background circa 12 yrs ago

24/06/2016, 12:03:17 pm: Nick: True, but you're in America mate
24/06/2016, 12:03:29 pm: Chris Raeburn: Having said that. If people are dumb enough to vote for this, they're certainly dumb enough to vote for trump

24/06/2016, 12:17:32 pm: Chris Raeburn: Democracy is overrated. Goose, when are you setting up your council?
24/06/2016, 12:18:20 pm: Hood: Gove and Johnson's victory speeches are more sickening than Farage's
24/06/2016, 12:25:24 pm: Nick: Could we (Boull√©) scrape together enough cash to buy a small island somewhere in the Pacific?
24/06/2016, 12:28:25 pm: Peter Boull√©: I would prefer to bankroll the Hackney Roots militia that finally installs a Gosschalk administration (two words i never thought id see side by side - we live in strange times indeed).
24/06/2016, 12:29:52 pm: Hood: Sturgeon's effectively saying another scottish referendum - see us later

24/06/2016, 12:58:21 pm: Gregor Riddles: I thought I'd inform y'all on this otherwise somber and saddening day, I asked Torun to marry me this morning in the highlands of Bonnie Scotland, to which she answered yes... Whilst the future of the U.K. is at best uncertain I still know a few great things: Norway is still Norway, Dulwichers still booaaas and T Dubs is a boaaasss. Whether we all move to an island in the Pacific, Scandinavia or stay put, we're all still going to lay it down! Big love, G Ribs x
24/06/2016, 12:59:13 pm: Hood: Congrats Mr Schneebles!

24/06/2016, 1:01:18 pm: Gregor Riddles: Not trying to steel Farage's thunder, but definitely good to know that couples can lay it down even in these shitty times...
24/06/2016, 1:03:48 pm: Mat Gallagher: Yes Gregorson, massive congratulations, so happy for you. 
Have you done this to get a Norwegian passport?
24/06/2016, 1:09:44 pm: Peter Boull√©: Great news Gregor, congrats to you and T-Dubs! Definitely a game changer that has instantly converted today into a glorious one which shall live on and be celebrated in the annals of dulwicher history.

25/06/2016, 2:59:38 am: Charlie Williamson: The really worrying one is the disparity between leave and remain voters on force for good/ force for ill. It's pretty shocking that leave voters think multiculturalism, social liberalism, environmental policies and feminism and even the Internet are all negative things. I just can't believe people think that way in Britain. Makes me sad about my country.

25/06/2016, 4:32:22 am: James Harris: Weve been trying to explain Brexit to various people at our hostel and the tour we went on today. Quite difficult.

25/06/2016, 9:51:00 am: Nick: ...and another 10k in the last 5
25/06/2016, 9:53:27 am: Dan Bear: I am so dismayed by the prospect of Brexit. The consequences of the UK's exit look very bleak
25/06/2016, 10:14:21 am: Hood: A sober bush-dwelling bear
25/06/2016, 10:25:25 am: Gregor Riddles: Woke up with some seriously fearful dread-ridden angst (all about Brexit, not marriage)... Daddy's got the fear. Could someone suggest a solution to this horror please?
25/06/2016, 12:35:07 pm: Gregor Riddles: 1,124,536: how to get this to 17 million?!?

25/06/2016, 2:50:29 pm: Nick: Got some stuff to do, but keen for something around 6?
25/06/2016, 3:24:16 pm: Gregor Riddles: Alternatively, my rents aren't in town, could host at there place near Tate Modern? (Would also require reduced booze purchase...)
25/06/2016, 3:44:14 pm: Nick: Certainly easier for me - team?
25/06/2016, 3:48:04 pm: Chris Raeburn: Sorry that not there to toast with you guys but congrats again G+T

27/06/2016, 10:56:40 pm: Joe Jackson: Wow out of the euro twice in 4 days...
27/06/2016, 10:57:48 pm: Mat Gallagher: That game was a piece of crap. England were shit. What a week
27/06/2016, 11:53:14 pm: Sam Davies: The Icelandic chanting was top quality though
27/06/2016, 11:53:44 pm: Chris Raeburn: Come on the Welsh!
27/06/2016, 11:54:07 pm: Sam Davies: So much for David Cameron's "Brits never quit" slogan

28/06/2016, 11:31:01 am: Hood: Incredible scenes at the european parliament
28/06/2016, 11:52:13 am: Joe Jackson: I didn't think Farage could become more obnoxious but apparently he can...
28/06/2016, 12:33:10 pm: Peter Boull√©: What are these scenes?
28/06/2016, 12:39:17 pm: Sam Davies: Farage being an obnoxious arse at the debate in the EU council
28/06/2016, 12:40:36 pm: Nick: He is totally out of his depth
29/06/2016, 9:13:06 am: Sam Davies: Boris is taking notes from Nigel and going full fascist
29/06/2016, 9:13:16 am: Sam Davies: <‚Äéimage omitted>
29/06/2016, 9:15:35 am: Peter Boull√©: Whilst i abhor both those statements sam, for my interest what is actually the link to Boris Johnson with either? One is a quote from Marine le Pen. Where does the other come from?
29/06/2016, 9:43:17 am: Joe Jackson: If you get half an hour this is very good: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07glx81
29/06/2016, 10:00:02 am: Sam Davies: It's obviously not an official Boris page but it's run by people who support him
29/06/2016, 10:10:24 am: Peter Boull√©: Right. So essentially some bloke has knocked those up on his computer and social media users are reacting like its official Boris Johnson campaign material. Dont get me wrong, i am mortified the leave campaign won and definitely do not want to see Boris as our next PM. However in my view the biggest enemy in all this is misinformation and dare i say that post is a classic example of misinformation...
29/06/2016, 10:11:58 am: Hood: Chozmonger! Happy birthday you old mucker.
29/06/2016, 10:13:06 am: Perkvez: Haps Das Birts Professor Chozmeister!
29/06/2016, 10:19:57 am: Peter Boull√©: Mongermeister! Happy bibbe dibbe you old Choz. Still a spring chicken. Look forward to seeing you this week!
29/06/2016, 10:48:19 am: Nick: Happy birthday Prof. Farnz! Looking forward to seeing you soon!
29/06/2016, 10:49:29 am: Nick: Are you some sort of "expert" Boull√©?
29/06/2016, 10:50:25 am: Arunani: Happy birf Chozmeister flex - London eagerly awaits Choz d'Oz
29/06/2016, 10:51:43 am: Charlie Williamson: Thanks boys!

29/06/2016, 11:03:21 am: Sam Davies: A classic example of misinformation
29/06/2016, 11:03:55 am: Sam Davies: Although the Le Pen quote is real, and shows the company he now keeps
29/06/2016, 11:24:21 am: Peter Boull√©: I mean, i very much doubt bojo and le pen hang out sam...
29/06/2016, 11:25:33 am: Hood: They do man in the lizard lair with cameron
29/06/2016, 11:27:35 am: Peter Boull√©: I heard Nick Griffin works behind the bar there now

29/06/2016, 11:35:12 am: Gregor Riddles: Serving the "jolly fascist" local craft...
29/06/2016, 12:13:02 pm: Sam Davies: In the proverbial sense given the referendum campaign he just ran...
29/06/2016, 12:19:59 pm: Nick: Yeah but I don't think BJ remotely wanted this result: It was an internal power-play that backfired on both him and Lizard Boy. In true Dulwicher style, dice were rolled and the results were poor
29/06/2016, 12:20:02 pm: Peter Boull√©: The Doolies is not the forum to be getting into this, but think is fair to say, whilst wholeheartedly disagreeing with him, Boris and Le Pen cannot in a proverbial or any other sensible sense be lumped together and their respective stances on the EU are motivated by very different factors.
29/06/2016, 12:20:52 pm: Nick: (Whereas Le Peen is a straight-up racist scumbag)
29/06/2016, 12:21:04 pm: Peter Boull√©: Yup. One unit scum.
29/06/2016, 12:24:54 pm: Sam Davies: BJ and Gove used the potential membership of Turkey to the EU as a tool to win votes
29/06/2016, 12:25:07 pm: Sam Davies: They played the race and religion card
29/06/2016, 12:25:46 pm: Sam Davies: And have consequently emboldened racists in the UK
29/06/2016, 12:30:54 pm: Peter Boull√©: As i said, not really the forum for getting into it. There are legitimate (non racist) concerns around having Turkey (and indeed a number of other) countries join the EU.
29/06/2016, 12:32:54 pm: Sam Davies: Of course there are but that's not how they pitched it during the campaign. I'll stop mentioning it here though
29/06/2016, 1:07:02 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Time for a little brexit and wish chazmuffin a happy bojo. I've booked for 12 people at the garden in the Albion at 6.30 on Wed 6th - although not entirely sure who is in and with how many plus refugees. Can everyone say who's in vote remain and with how many or forever hold le pen?
29/06/2016, 1:12:36 pm: Peter Boull√©: I angela merkel it on the 6rh sadly.
29/06/2016, 1:14:50 pm: Nick: Awful
29/06/2016, 1:16:19 pm: Nick: Camille and I are CorbIN
29/06/2016, 1:41:10 pm: Sam Davies: Hans Solo
29/06/2016, 6:34:23 pm: James Harris: Happy Birthday Charlie. Won't make the 6th unfortunately but we are back on 19th if you're still around.
29/06/2016, 6:56:30 pm: Mat Gallagher: Happy birthday chozer! X
29/06/2016, 6:57:35 pm: Joe Jackson: Happy birthday Charlie!

30/06/2016, 12:25:13 am: Charlie Williamson: Sorry James. Over and out on 11th
30/06/2016, 1:54:09 am: Hood: We should add bonbon to this thread
30/06/2016, 10:02:16 am: Perkvez: Do it!

30/06/2016, 1:17:20 pm: Sam Davies: And with Gove stabbing BJ in the back British politics goes full game of thrones
30/06/2016, 1:40:28 pm: Peter Boull√©: I actually laughed out loud when i read that this morning. Whole thing has become a genuine farce.
30/06/2016, 1:42:33 pm: Sam Davies: Johnson to run again in two years when everything has gone tits up?
30/06/2016, 1:48:01 pm: Mat Gallagher: Yes absolutely. He has gained the support of the tory membership by being leave but doesn't want to deal with the shit soup he has created. When may/gove cock it up he slides his way back.
I increasingly think we need to bribe David milliband to come back
30/06/2016, 1:49:17 pm: Sam Davies: Can we just all move to Canada?
30/06/2016, 2:07:39 pm: James Harris: <‚Äéimage omitted>
30/06/2016, 2:10:56 pm: Hood: I was with the devil's mercenary himself last night - Isaac Levido. He'd spent the day with Bojo and step 1 for today was getting him a haircut. They had not predicted Gove's treachery. 24 hours is a long time in politics.
30/06/2016, 2:10:56 pm: Hood: Parachuted into Jo Cox's seat?
30/06/2016, 2:16:17 pm: James Harris: I can't see Gove winning elections he is seriously unlikeable and hated by every teacher in the country. Labour would be in a pretty strong position if they could just unite around a semi charismatic and competent leader.
30/06/2016, 2:18:05 pm: Perkvez: I've heard if you say "come back David!" 3 times he'll marginally appear as the new labour leader.
30/06/2016, 5:39:04 pm: Chris Raeburn: This is starting to become high farce. The following thread from an Economist analyst is disturbing (albeit outdated in a post-BJ environment).

03/07/2016, 10:52:09 pm: Hood: Greatly looking for Choz's re-entry on Weds. Anyone free between now and then, perhaps around the Gillett Square area between the hours of 9 and 5?
04/07/2016, 3:18:42 am: Marc Gosschalk: Good news is we've moved from the Albion to the Narrowboat to accommodate the wales semi finals in the euros. Still haven't heard from everyone planning on attending with their better halfs and quarters, but the table is for 6.30 and it'll be hard to hold if we aren't doolie assembled.

Stronkforce, I'm afraid I'm entirely unavailable Monday and Tuesday but maybe wedders
04/07/2016, 10:15:07 am: Charlie Williamson: Thanks chalky!! We will be there on the dot. What's the address?

05/07/2016, 1:20:26 am: Marc Gosschalk: Bubbles? It's all about the rhetoric... (A reference to boulle's dastardly tactics during back to back wins in supposedly friendly games of monopoly)

The narrowboat, for any shy Dulwichers who haven't been already, is on the canal a few minutes walk from Angel, 119 st Peter's street, N1 8PZ
05/07/2016, 1:25:28 am: Peter Boull√©: I fear my divide and conquer approach is not what Britain needs right now. Im formally declaring myself out of the race.
05/07/2016, 1:28:41 am: Hood: Thanks for the recommendation. Let's hope Gove or May buy into the well-being agenda.
05/07/2016, 3:38:53 pm: Mat Gallagher: Aussie Chozer üá≥üáø. I'm really sorry but I've been rotad to work tmw night and I can get out of it. I've offered bribes and eu love but no.

Thursday is good for me, Wednesday may not be possible as I'm off tomorrow for a 3-night gathering of tech coops in Sheffield. I've been specifically told by the organiser to not poop on their tech parade.

So my vote is strongly Thursday, although outside chance I bail early. You guys?
14/11/2016, 12:09:56 am: Sam Davies: I can't do this Thursday. What about the week after, say Wednesday 23rd?

14/12/2016, 5:38:45 pm: Mat Gallagher: Ha. OK well we have the choice of two choice Italians. La porchetta in Exmouth market or little sardegna in Finsbury Park. 
People's vote?
14/12/2016, 5:40:25 pm: Sam Davies: Exmouth market - better pubs nearby and easier to get to/from
14/12/2016, 5:43:15 pm: Joe Jackson: Either is good for me!
14/12/2016, 5:52:41 pm: Gregor Riddles: Easy either way, except food and vibe is truly bossin at Sardegna, small and unique, can't judge la porchington, grandpappie's never been. You're call team...
14/12/2016, 8:05:34 pm: Sam Davies: La porchetta won't be as atmospheric then and is mainly pizza. It's much easier for anyone not in North London though. Up to them I think
14/12/2016, 8:08:06 pm: Gregor Riddles: Good logic! South Londoners, what's your wibe? Let me know tonight if poss either way as should cancel without them wanting to ring ma wee puny Celtic neck...
14/12/2016, 8:13:46 pm: Mat Gallagher: Let's go to the wee Scot man's Italian delight. It ain't a chain and I like that. I'll cancel my reservation. Unless the silent others think otherwise...
14/12/2016, 8:14:45 pm: Gregor Riddles: Daddy and Matty double booked...

30/12/2016, 4:45:21 pm: James Harris: Nick it would great if you could do a desert.

01/01/2017, 11:12:58 am: Perkvez: How is Ellie?
01/01/2017, 11:13:48 am: Perkvez: And happy 2017 to all!
01/01/2017, 1:32:29 pm: Chris Raeburn: Cheers guys. Ellie is doing ok, better now that she is into the second tri. I'm going to be looking to Amir and Arunan as the sages of Dulwich. Any advice?
01/01/2017, 1:36:16 pm: Arunani: Stick to vodka and spirits pre-delivery then move on to wine üç∑ post- delivery. Get some sleep. Try and get a Mexican au pair before the Wall goes up.
01/01/2017, 1:36:48 pm: Arunani: But overall you'll love it
01/01/2017, 1:46:08 pm: Chris Raeburn: Thanks. I heard a joint would help ease any pain during delivery. How many should I smoke?
01/01/2017, 1:47:32 pm: Arunani: 2 for a c-section and 11 for natural delivery
01/01/2017, 1:48:31 pm: Arunani: Are you having baby in USA or GB?
01/01/2017, 1:48:49 pm: Chris Raeburn: üá∫üá∏
02/01/2017, 10:29:53 am: Perkvez: At this point just be there for Ellie and allow her to use you as her living stress ball. Though I'm sure you already are :)
02/01/2017, 10:34:14 am: Perkvez: Oh and constant compliments about how they look (you look beautiful/glowing etc) seem to help given that they inflate at an impressive rate.
02/01/2017, 12:45:46 pm: Nick: <‚Äéimage omitted>
02/01/2017, 2:17:27 pm: Hood: Woah. What a stream of 100 messages to tune into! Tanti auguri Christopher + Ellie. I like Arunan's advice. Chris I think you can do 11 at once.
02/01/2017, 2:26:01 pm: Nick: Gregor that video is priceless
02/01/2017, 2:40:09 pm: Marc Gosschalk: That video... Boys! You must be such a comic and welcome addition. Although you can't please everyone all the time. Boys.
07/01/2017, 1:23:42 pm: Perkvez: Good day chapsters. Any plans for a meet this Eve?
08/01/2017, 10:27:37 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Aww perkstein, tough crowd. I had an old colleagues birthday you'll be interested to know. But please try again, make me proud...
08/01/2017, 11:29:48 pm: Perkvez: Yah, disappointing. But can't expect everyone to be waiting when I finally come out of me cave :)
08/01/2017, 11:32:07 pm: Perkvez: Indeed. I'll keep an eye on communications to see if there's anything I can jump on to

11/01/2017, 5:40:52 pm: Joe Jackson: In hackney - balls deep in my tax return... did anyone else watch trumps press conference? Recommend doing it on Facebook for the angry faces...

11/01/2017, 6:05:43 pm: Sam Davies: I was reading the live text
11/01/2017, 6:06:05 pm: Sam Davies: He's like an angry toddler
11/01/2017, 8:40:16 pm: Perkvez: Who's going to be the most powerful man on the planet...
12/01/2017, 10:49:49 am: James Harris: Hopefully he'll get impeached. It's all very House of Cards.
12/01/2017, 11:21:05 am: Mat Gallagher: Have you read the buzzfeed dossier it is incredible. It's like a John le carre novel. The only thing which makes me doubt it is that if the media have had it for so long why has none of it been verified or at least other evidence for bits of it dug up.
12/01/2017, 11:27:14 am: Perkvez: Because that would require proper journalism
12/01/2017, 11:31:12 am: Marc Gosschalk: Wabbaquacker. A reference to Parvez's columbo impression, filmed circa '00. Niche
12/01/2017, 1:23:19 pm: Sam Davies: Apparently no-one wrote about it because they hadn't seen the tapes
12/01/2017, 1:23:39 pm: Sam Davies: Although the evidence is supposed to be credible
12/01/2017, 1:23:56 pm: Sam Davies: http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/can-donald-trump-really-compromised-agent-russian-influence/?ncid=newsletter-uk
12/01/2017, 2:13:24 pm: James Harris: Apparently the big pornsites are offering millions of $ for the trump sex tapes.
13/01/2017, 4:51:11 pm: Marc Gosschalk: If anyone wants to join juju, sykes and I tonight, we'll be misbehavin' somewhere north east
13/01/2017, 5:03:56 pm: Perkvez: "Somewhere north east"

Could you be more specific?
13/01/2017, 5:05:43 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Ah please come perky, maybe around jujus off rotherfield or at a pub in london fields?
13/01/2017, 5:07:41 pm: Hood: Parvez back on the scene
13/01/2017, 5:07:45 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Would make me feel like this commentator (I have this playing in my head a lot these days) https://youtu.be/WHVAHFwPCEQ
13/01/2017, 7:42:30 pm: Perkvez: And for that feeling I'm in...
13/01/2017, 7:49:30 pm: Marc Gosschalk: So deece. On my way to meet ibs and the london fields brewery now. Gol de scholes
13/01/2017, 7:50:17 pm: Perkvez: Cool cool. I'll head out in a bit
13/01/2017, 9:41:11 pm: Perkvez: So where's you at now Goessen?
14/01/2017, 11:10:33 am: Sam Davies: Doolies in London - I'm planning some birthday drinks for next weekend. Are people free on Friday or Saturday evening?
14/01/2017, 12:19:34 pm: James Harris: Saturday better for me but can do either
14/01/2017, 3:10:51 pm: Perkvez: Sorry Sam, I'll be in Punjabland by then.
14/01/2017, 4:06:51 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Im planning on joining my cousin lou's bday at some point on friday night but could do both
14/01/2017, 4:43:13 pm: Dan Bear: Happy for both üëª
14/01/2017, 5:39:13 pm: Sam Davies: Great. Sounds like Saturday is the day. I'll let you know where
17/01/2017, 7:13:08 pm: Sam Davies: Putin on Trump
17/01/2017, 7:13:11 pm: Sam Davies: Trump is ‚Äúa grown man, and secondly he‚Äôs someone who has been involved with beauty contests for many years and has met the most beautiful women in the world,‚Äù Putin said. ‚ÄúI find it hard to believe that he rushed to some hotel to meet girls of loose morals, although ours are undoubtedly the best in the world.‚Äù
17/01/2017, 7:25:00 pm: James Harris: Probably the best loose moralled girls in the world
17/01/2017, 8:25:40 pm: Hood: Not probably - undoubtedly

19/01/2017, 2:17:40 pm: Perkvez: Happy Bs Sir Sam. Hope you have a great one!
19/01/2017, 2:46:31 pm: Sam Davies: Thanks Amir

20/01/2017, 5:36:49 pm: Fombonne: It'll piss him off
20/01/2017, 5:37:06 pm: Hood: Don't feed the machine
20/01/2017, 5:38:39 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Ooooh the ol' abstenshwan! Strong move hood, strong move. And bonboni. I watch the machine. I like to watch.
20/01/2017, 5:45:33 pm: Marc Gosschalk: If god is watching he must have mixed feelings. Getting his ass kissed by some dubious characters. Choral yat spied.
20/01/2017, 5:47:08 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Hood youre missing your alternative life as an American chorist chasing decency
20/01/2017, 6:09:32 pm: Sam Davies: His speech is a pile of üí©
20/01/2017, 6:14:53 pm: Joe Jackson: Well you can tell he wrote this speech himself... it makes no sense whatsoever

28/01/2017, 11:05:34 pm: Gregor Riddles: No worries about flakiness James, but, yes, tennis is a go go tomorrow. Starts 830am, need to sort my HDMI cable situ, if anyone has a spare, please bring...
29/01/2017, 12:17:34 am: James Harris: Cool. I can bring an hdmi cable. 8.30 might be a tad ambitious though. What are you steaming it on?
29/01/2017, 12:18:12 am: Gregor Riddles: Eurosport
29/01/2017, 9:51:01 am: Sam Davies: Do you still need the hdmi cable? I'm about to leave
29/01/2017, 9:51:48 am: Gregor Riddles: Nope, all sorted

29/01/2017, 10:36:30 am: Gregor Riddles: No worries, got stuff
29/01/2017, 12:17:01 pm: James Harris: Tense. So who's going to win chozza?
29/01/2017, 12:27:53 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Holy sheet
29/01/2017, 12:42:23 pm: James Harris: Did nadal just shit himself?
29/01/2017, 12:51:58 pm: Charlie Williamson: Fedal
29/01/2017, 12:52:16 pm: Charlie Williamson: My Aussie dollars on feddy
29/01/2017, 1:16:54 pm: Arunani: Yes! KingFed
29/01/2017, 1:39:50 pm: Charlie Williamson: Done and dusted. Enjoying the kingly nod from rocket rod üöÄ
29/01/2017, 1:44:32 pm: Arunani: Just to clarify - did Nadal actually shit himself?
29/01/2017, 1:47:55 pm: Charlie Williamson: Bird poo apparently.
29/01/2017, 1:48:06 pm: Gregor Riddles: Sick
29/01/2017, 1:48:10 pm: Gregor Riddles: It was sick
29/01/2017, 1:48:16 pm: Gregor Riddles: As in... vomit
29/01/2017, 1:48:26 pm: Arunani: Bird vomit?
29/01/2017, 1:48:53 pm: Gregor Riddles: Nadal vom... evariwaaaar
29/01/2017, 1:49:03 pm: Arunani: üòÇ
29/01/2017, 1:49:28 pm: Arunani: Casually mopped up by the ballgirl
29/01/2017, 1:57:26 pm: Charlie Williamson: It's a dirty job...
31/01/2017, 6:56:08 am: Gregor Riddles: All explained in the summarising Guardian article:

"At 0-2 down, Federer had the trainer on to rub his right thigh ‚Äì but there was an entirely different sort of interlude when a ball kid had to clean up a deposit by a passing bird right on the service line as Nadal stepped up in the fourth game. Even seagulls are Federer fans."

Relief to know Nadal can control his bowel...
31/01/2017, 7:11:23 am: Charlie Williamson: I knew it!
31/01/2017, 9:07:52 am: Peter Boull√©: So have two free tickets to see Skunk at Brixton Academy on Saturday, doors open 7pm. Any takers?
31/01/2017, 5:07:12 pm: Hood: Not all at once
31/01/2017, 5:47:02 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Ha I would be all over it but, weak as I am, I'm entertaining my cousin Claire and her friend Annick who'll be staying in the Clapton lair. If anyone wants to join for some alternative Saturday evening frolickings, come to me. Don't vote Pete.
31/01/2017, 7:38:40 pm: Peter Boull√©: I quite literally cannot give them away...

08/02/2017, 11:49:59 am: Gregor Riddles: All can be forgiven if so...
08/02/2017, 11:53:27 am: Mat Gallagher: So Alex dearie what are you to do? This is brilliant
08/02/2017, 11:54:13 am: Gregor Riddles: I think this is her Fb profile...

08/02/2017, 12:37:16 pm: Joe Jackson: Your eating a lot a potato chips at the moment by the sounds of it...
08/02/2017, 1:22:39 pm: Nick: The beginning of the lockdown
08/02/2017, 1:23:26 pm: Nick: Snookered
08/02/2017, 1:32:25 pm: Charlie Williamson: I have one question. Just why are the potato crisps so hard to find at the Nakumatt?
08/02/2017, 2:47:42 pm: Peter Boull√©: Think you need to buy you potato crisps somewhere else.
08/02/2017, 6:21:22 pm: Dan Bear: üòç
08/02/2017, 6:36:12 pm: James Harris: Valentine's Day could be interesting. Expect a lovingly wrapped pack of crisps.
08/02/2017, 6:37:33 pm: Chris Raeburn: Jonathan Crisps?
08/02/2017, 6:42:26 pm: Peter Boull√©: St. John! üçîüçî
08/02/2017, 10:37:00 pm: Charlie Williamson: Has anyone noticed there is a tv series on Netflix called 'The OA'. Massively disappointed when I watched the trailer it wasn't a biopic on a duwlicher.
10/02/2017, 3:57:28 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Alex Hood. Loved by ladies. Lover of potato crisps.

Anyone up for a shambolic Dulwicher international google hangout this weekend? No time is a good time for everyone, but how about 2.30pm GMT to see hood getting his game face on and give him some reminders on how to help women realise they're better off alone
10/02/2017, 7:07:10 pm: Joe Jackson: Anyone keen to watch the rugby in the pub tomorrow - Sam I'm looking at you...
10/02/2017, 7:18:22 pm: Sam Davies: I'm in Devon actually so I won't be around

11/02/2017, 3:26:17 pm: Chris Raeburn: Just read Ellie your letter. She votes for the date
11/02/2017, 11:06:34 pm: Hood: Thanks guys. I decided to write a short response and leave it with the staff to give the lone Mercy to ponder. I used a quote from M People to wrap it up. You got to search for the hero inside yourself. I also set the record straight on the potato chips. In fact today was my first day off since G&T visited, while Tim has visitors from Rome staying so was actually good reason to join their plans instead. I've been out of the loop entirely of late as I have EY auditing my ass. Would still like a WDF international summit. Open webinars:
1) "Stoking the stagmin" 2) "Dexile: desertion or diaspora?"
3) "DC: fundamentalists meet fascists"
...Refreshments...
 4) "Dooly descendants: the next generation"
5) "Burnstein's schlong: navigating a post-truth world"
... Intermission ...
6) "D4G: what does the future hold?"
7) "Where do women go?"
11/02/2017, 11:13:03 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Makes up for the lack of date tales with a solid whatsapp message. Classy move. Up for trying vebinar tomorrow, say 2.30pm again? Would also like to propose a couple of topics including 'Dan Holman: Fundamentalist Dulwicher' and 'Father & Son vs Father & Son'
11/02/2017, 11:17:07 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Also, maybe it's time to bring back the DeeCe Reading Society, or indeed to set up The Film Club. CV needs all the help it can get
17/02/2017, 12:18:26 am: Fombonne: <‚Äéimage omitted>
17/02/2017, 12:20:07 am: Arunani: Yup - he's the BBC Pakistan correspondent - lives in Lahore now
17/02/2017, 12:20:28 am: Fombonne: What a pro.
17/02/2017, 12:21:56 am: Fombonne: Arunan, coming to Ontario any time? Remember to hit me up if you do!
17/02/2017, 12:28:11 am: Arunani: It's been a while mate - I may come for a week in the summer for a placement so will let you know - you can hook me up with Trudeau
17/02/2017, 12:29:24 am: Fombonne: Nice. I'll let the wifey set you up - she's obsessed with him...we're looking pretty good up here with everything going on south of the border...
17/02/2017, 12:29:57 am: Arunani: And across the pond too...
17/02/2017, 6:21:53 am: Perkvez: Everyone to Canada when WW3 hits, eh?
17/02/2017, 7:33:59 am: Charlie Williamson: Haha just listened to secunder's interview on my daily BBC world news podcast. So weird!
17/02/2017, 10:44:48 am: Gregor Riddles: Anyone up for dinner on Sunday night?
17/02/2017, 8:43:06 pm: Marc Gosschalk: I would be but im otherwise schleiffed. In better news, today is the day bonboni's legendary naze celebrates it's 32nd birthday. ü§ó
17/02/2017, 9:10:00 pm: Hood: Oh right! Happy birthday Bonboon
17/02/2017, 9:12:47 pm: Fombonne: Thank you, sirs. Was actually the 15th but appreciate the nazal appreciation.
17/02/2017, 9:15:55 pm: Chris Raeburn: A cruel man would make a joke about it taking two days for the naze to fully emerge but I'm hardly in a position to make that funny.
17/02/2017, 9:18:59 pm: Fombonne: It's worth the two-day wait
17/02/2017, 10:28:29 pm: Marc Gosschalk: https://youtu.be/eQmO1ZtypM8
17/02/2017, 10:36:00 pm: Charlie Williamson: Happy belated bonbon day!

05/03/2017, 8:19:37 am: Hood: Hi Doolies, Gregsonian's stag will be in Berlin on 30th June - 2nd July. That's having deliberated the convenient Doodle, the Dooly calendario and my return to UK. For your advance info, Drew and I would recommend taking the Friday off. Details to follow. Will be Cronk fest o'clock.
05/03/2017, 12:04:21 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Deece. Although disappointed by no uptake on the other big event, the Dulwich Park Duck Feed. Still on for this afternoon if any takers

09/03/2017, 8:20:06 pm: Hood: Measured, always in control, firm grasp of his limits... just leave it at the half thenüç™üç™üç™üç™üç™üç™üç™üç™
10/03/2017, 9:06:40 am: James Harris: Great insight on the voices inside your head Marc but can't make tonight, off skiing for a week. Well up for feeding some ü¶Ü  or a few üçª soon though.
10/03/2017, 9:32:38 am: Mat Gallagher: Marcus. I'm afraid I'm off on a stag this weekend so whilst you are fine dining I will be drinking on the train to Bristol. Thanks for the invite though, I'd love to come another time. X
11/03/2017, 9:21:47 am: Peter Boull√©: Any doolies around ce swibs and up for dinner?
11/03/2017, 4:09:29 pm: Dan Bear: Yep sounds good :)
17/03/2017, 4:58:54 pm: Dan Bear: Anyone fancy a üçªüçïor üçîtonight?
17/03/2017, 4:59:59 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Come along to josh sykes bday on hackney road
17/03/2017, 5:00:31 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Casual bar. I can offer bread and eggs beforehand
18/03/2017, 2:18:28 pm: Gregor Riddles: How was last night Marcus? I went to T Dubs gig in west London, didn't get back until late. Torun and her sister are in London at the mo and free Tuesday night if you fancy hang/pint/yoga?!?
18/03/2017, 3:04:24 pm: Joe Jackson: Keen for some food and a pint on Tuesday...
18/03/2017, 3:06:13 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Shucks got to get my Africa Week face on on Tuesday evening but could try and say hello after if you're not far? Keen to see t-dibbles and sis, gotta be comedy
18/03/2017, 11:27:30 pm: Hood: Marc 'Rutte-tut-tutte' Gosschalk
20/03/2017, 4:40:59 pm: Gregor Riddles: So lads, tomorrow still good? I was thinking nice pub hang out east? Torun's sister has never really been to Dalston/Hackney and keen to show her. Let me know who's game and the most suitable location. G Ribs
20/03/2017, 8:09:30 pm: James Harris: I'm around for summit after work tomorrow. Somewhere in hackney good but can we stay reasonably near some transport?
20/03/2017, 8:11:01 pm: Joe Jackson: Yep still keen!
20/03/2017, 11:03:56 pm: Mat Gallagher: I'm in full decorating mode this week unfortunately.
21/03/2017, 12:24:13 am: Marc Gosschalk: I'll be finishing a meeting in Dalston around 8.30, come uno bosso
21/03/2017, 2:21:59 pm: Gregor Riddles: So, we've got Charris, Chalk and King o pop keen for tonight?
21/03/2017, 2:24:35 pm: Gregor Riddles: Tibs and her sis are flexible. They're either up for a post work pre dinner pint around 6ish or post dinner around 8/9ish. What suits everyone better? Location arbitrary, but have vaguely said east as Gjertrud's never been east of the yard!
21/03/2017, 3:37:49 pm: Joe Jackson: We're flexible too... there are a couple of decent pubs between london fields and Dalston
21/03/2017, 4:31:43 pm: Joe Jackson: Actually later would be better for me...
21/03/2017, 4:37:58 pm: Gregor Riddles: So the ladies have decided they'd prefer pre-dinner hang as want to stay at home for dinner. So, if still feasible for those available, somewhere 6/630ish in London Fields? Name a good pub and I'll be there, G
21/03/2017, 5:53:17 pm: Gregor Riddles: It's looking like the early signs of full blown bail-aaaage. The ladies want it early, Chalk cannae do early, Jacko more keen for late too. Can I suggest a pint Thursday or Friday nights instead? G Ribs
21/03/2017, 5:55:25 pm: James Harris: That would be better for me too tbh
21/03/2017, 5:56:51 pm: Gregor Riddles: Cool
21/03/2017, 5:57:05 pm: Joe Jackson: Ok sounds good
21/03/2017, 5:57:30 pm: Sam Davies: Thursday or Friday would be much better for me as well
21/03/2017, 5:57:54 pm: Gregor Riddles: Great. Post dinner Thursday?
21/03/2017, 6:06:10 pm: Nick: Elegantly sacked off

22/03/2017, 7:19:18 pm: Sam Davies: Excel spreadsheets aside. Did you get the weed at least?
22/03/2017, 9:22:51 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Apparently another teacher heard a joke or something, so no pick up and no worries. I did once ask for rizla - that could've done it. All good though, just one for the close shave list
24/03/2017, 12:34:14 pm: Peter Boull√©: Sooo. Is dinner aown tonight?

24/03/2017, 4:21:13 pm: Dan Bear: Would be keen to join too
24/03/2017, 4:23:54 pm: Gregor Riddles: I'm going to have dinner with my sister, she's keen to catch up and haven't seen for a while, but game for drinks post dinner?
24/03/2017, 4:25:21 pm: Peter Boull√©: Sacked off by Daddy. The final straw.
24/03/2017, 4:25:57 pm: Gregor Riddles: Daddy isn'tae a sackin'

25/03/2017, 6:08:15 pm: Dan Bear: I'd be up for sacking that
25/03/2017, 6:10:37 pm: Sam Davies: Where are you planning to sack that?
25/03/2017, 6:10:45 pm: Gregor Riddles: <‚Äéimage omitted>
25/03/2017, 6:15:29 pm: James Harris: It almost doesn't matter, as we are going to sack it off anyway, but I was thinking a pub. Maybe catch the last of the sun, somewhere. Brixton, kings cross? Depends who's joining/sacking it off?
25/03/2017, 6:18:58 pm: Gregor Riddles: I'd love to sack this one off but instead flying to Oslo, can't sack that one off. Back in town on 9 April for a whole new round of sacking offs, hope you're as excited as me! Gx
25/03/2017, 6:23:42 pm: James Harris: See you soon Greg. Just to be clear, I am actually up something tonight. Maybe some food?
25/03/2017, 6:33:42 pm: Sam Davies: Kings cross?
25/03/2017, 6:43:56 pm: James Harris: Yes
25/03/2017, 7:03:31 pm: Dan Bear: Yep can do that
25/03/2017, 7:03:50 pm: Dan Bear: Somewhere you know?
25/03/2017, 8:29:44 pm: James Harris: Just met Sam at a pub by the canal on granary square. The lighterman.
25/03/2017, 10:08:27 pm: Peter Boull√©: Not too late to sack it off guys. Sam just pretend you need the loo and leave.
25/03/2017, 11:36:02 pm: James Harris: Nice evening but eventually we decided to sack it off

27/03/2017, 7:32:57 pm: Hood: I resigned from this job last week. My lawyer here has told me my undocumented illegal immigrant status here is punishable with a prison sentence and I cannot go near the office. As my company hangs by a regulatory thread, 5 inspectors from the Bank of Tanzania have bedded into the office for 3 weeks and hounding me down for answers. Other government agents arrived at my house this morning but I'd already left to work in a coffee shop. I've since been lying low in a friend's house during which time agents came to hunt me in the office. The lawyer now says I should leave the country immediately. My flight to Kenya leaves crack of dawn tomorrow. I withdrew $1,000 cash for my escape. Will be packing my bag under cover of darkness, 3.30am taxi booked, unsure if I will be able to return. mwercy
27/03/2017, 7:35:33 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Oh ma goooooodness

27/03/2017, 7:51:48 pm: Gregor Riddles: Christ Hood, this sounds like Cowboy outlaw shit... good luck and stay safe!
27/03/2017, 8:02:38 pm: Nick: Jesus hood - hope you make it home safely!

28/03/2017, 9:23:39 am: Charlie Williamson: Never has an update been so anticipated since American pie 2.
28/03/2017, 9:28:33 am: Marc Gosschalk: üê°

28/03/2017, 1:32:04 pm: Hood: Thanks guys. Master of suspense - I'm oot

28/03/2017, 1:35:12 pm: Peter Boull√©: Great. So no need to parachute in Black-ops Bernard to effect an extraction.

28/03/2017, 1:51:52 pm: Joe Jackson: Striker strikes again! üí•
28/03/2017, 1:52:31 pm: Joe Jackson: So what are you going to do now - r&r in Kenya or head back to london?
28/03/2017, 9:31:06 pm: Hood: Pleased to be out of there. Bonus that Nairobi is decent so far - seems prim and yatty. Never mind Tanzit, what about legs-it? Got to see out my notice somehow and find a (prob Tanzo) replacement or the company may crumble. The calls, emails, reg deadlines, crises etc continue apace wherever I am. I think this thing really just comes from having no proper HR and TNZ having nonsensical rules. The officials who came hunting me were also apparently quite shclubby and wore ill fitting shirts. Prob out to make a quick buck / gifty but still don't want to go down that route when this lawyer said 'you have no defence, you've been working illegally'. Next move will unfold over next few weeks. Still eyeing an end June return but that could change.
28/03/2017, 9:57:24 pm: Charlie Williamson: Phew well done hoodlum
29/03/2017, 11:04:09 am: Nick: Measured words from the economist as usual:

07/04/2017, 6:09:07 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Old street?
07/04/2017, 6:33:37 pm: Marc Gosschalk: Angel??
07/04/2017, 6:39:26 pm: Chris Raeburn: After the nuclear sack do you just need a simple majority for future sacks, rather than the traditional 60%?
07/04/2017, 6:44:07 pm: James Harris: I can't make tonight, heading to deepest south London. Free tmrw though, if this weather holds I'd be up for a prime pub garden somewhere or even the first BBQ of the year
07/04/2017, 7:10:37 pm: Dan Bear: First in the sack race!

08/06/2017, 11:55:59 pm: James Harris: Well hung

08/06/2017, 11:57:11 pm: Hood: Gives minority parties much more power

09/06/2017, 2:23:07 am: Marc Gosschalk: Daddy says what's interesting is that the forecast for seats hasn't changed since the exit poll, and that if that sticks for another hour or so we could well be decently hung
09/06/2017, 2:26:02 am: Marc Gosschalk: and yes, I also cried foul at the offing of a bo job

09/06/2017, 9:53:57 am: Sam Davies: Yes. Worst high five ever?

28/06/2017, 12:10:04 pm: James Harris: Good luck mate, don't take any selfies during hearing/sentencing, might piss the magistrate off!
28/06/2017, 12:10:37 pm: Gregor Riddles: What even is a magistrate?
28/06/2017, 12:10:44 pm: Gregor Riddles: What's a judge?
28/06/2017, 12:10:50 pm: Gregor Riddles: What's the law?
28/06/2017, 12:10:51 pm: Hood: See you've dressed up like a Victorian rag and bone man for the occasion
28/06/2017, 12:13:28 pm: Gregor Riddles: Velvet = gracefully anti-establishment I'd say...

28/06/2017, 12:57:17 pm: Hood: Given Greg's eta from court is maybe late tonight/tomorrow?! Should probably get the show on the road! I can't meet that early tho
28/06/2017, 12:57:20 pm: Perkvez: Hopefully by then Gregs will be free from the judicial tyranny which hounds him
28/06/2017, 12:58:43 pm: Perkvez: Should we start a fb group,

28/06/2017, 1:35:17 pm: Gregor Riddles: This is such a waste of time. Hanging in waiting room with some sketchy youngsters probably busted for possession of dube...
28/06/2017, 1:36:56 pm: Perkvez: You  should see if they got a "smoke"
28/06/2017, 1:37:36 pm: Perkvez: Offer the judge one too
28/06/2017, 1:52:25 pm: Hood: I forgot you did part of a law degree Parvez. Top advice!
28/06/2017, 1:53:06 pm: Charlie Williamson: Only if you're in a Scottish court.
28/06/2017, 1:53:07 pm: Perkvez: Finally comes in handy..

28/06/2017, 6:54:16 pm: Peter Boull√©: A dance as old as time itself
28/06/2017, 7:01:28 pm: Perkvez: Should be around the wigmore street area in 30 mins or so if anyone able to meet lil early.
28/06/2017, 7:01:49 pm: Hood: Feld looking to meet early
28/06/2017, 7:11:08 pm: Perkvez: What's his number? I ain't gat.

28/06/2017, 7:12:00 pm: Perkvez: Also quite good
28/06/2017, 7:12:28 pm: Hood: Maybe he's lost his phone
28/06/2017, 7:17:17 pm: Gregor Riddles: Think I'll get there for 730ish. Yup, Feld keen to hang early. His no is 07949 830705. See y'all soon, G

Could also do it for charitas if your pro bono portfolio is looking fairly scant at the mo (Boulle). Would also be good time for a visit if you didnt get round to it last year.

More importantly she is having drinks to celebrate on the Saturday the 7th October at 8.00pm at the Talbot in De Beauvoir to which you are all invited! I know it late notice but she would love to see you all and help her celebrate - it would also help me no end if you tell her that being 30 is awesome rather than telling her the sad horrible truth...

28/09/2017, 6:15:49 pm: Peter Boull√©: Merely a tentative step towards a wider and longer term assessment as to whether a person one is dating might have meaningful potential. What better way to assess a potential partner's prospects than to thrust them into the waiting jaws of the dulwicher lions skulking in their den?
28/09/2017, 6:16:49 pm: Gregor Riddles: He shall't be embraced

Bunnage a concern for me also. I'm spending money like I'm earning non-African money. Climbing Kili in 2 weeks. Then down under in Dece. Could prob find a way but you're the only one who's expressed an interest Greg.
07/10/2017, 1:59:12 pm: James Harris: I have a theoretical interest but money and leave quite tight at the moment. Also depends on how our house move pans out.
